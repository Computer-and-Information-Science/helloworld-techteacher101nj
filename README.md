Change the code so that instead of saying "Hello World" it says "Hello Object Oriented Programming", and then compile and test. 
Additionally try these out and see what errors you get. Document your errors here in the readme. (This is taken from Exercise 3 in the text book).

Remove one of the closing curly braces.

Instead of main, write mian.

Remove the word static.

Remove the word public.

Remove the word System.

Replace println with Println.

Replace println with print.
